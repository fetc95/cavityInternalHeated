# PHT OpenFOAM Lab53 IACP FEB RAS

OpenFOAM solvers for simulating heat transfer processes in porous media (porous heat transfer, PHT)

# Overview

In project **PHT OpenFOAM Lab53 IACP FEB RAS**, we develop the OpenFOAM solvers and libraries to simulate the transient fluid flow and heat transfer in porous media. The solvers are developed in the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics of [Institute of Automation and Controll Processes FEB RAS](www.iacp.dvo.ru) and [Far Eastern Federal University](www.dvfu.ru).

**phtEnthalpyFoam** &mdash; fluid flow in porous media without phase changes and chemical reactions.

# Description
The solvers were developed on [OpenFOAM from OpenCFD](www.openfoam.com) v2012 and tested for versions v1906, v1912, v2006, v2012.
