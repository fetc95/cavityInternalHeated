# PHT OpenFOAM Lab53 IACP FEB RAS
### OpenFOAM solvers for simulating heat transfer processes in porous media (porous heat transfer, PHT)
The solvers are developed in the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics of Institute of Automation and Controll Processes FEB RAS (www.iacp.dvo.ru) and Far Eastern Federal University (www.dvfu.ru).
The solvers were tested for OpenFOAM from OpenCFD (www.openfoam.com) versions v1906, 1912, 2006, 2012
